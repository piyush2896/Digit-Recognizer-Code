# Kaggle Digit Recognizer Challenge
This repository contains code to tackle the [Digit Recognizer Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).<br/>

## Warning
For First Time KNN users, it ran whole night to get me the result. It's not the best approach, and it just an experiment, can't be used in production cases without distributed processing.

## Usage
Run ipynb file to get the result.csv file.

## Current Accuracy
The current accuracy of the code is **0.96700**. Still trying to improve it.
